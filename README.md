🖼️ Image Filter & Preset Editor (Canvas-Based)

This project is a browser-based image editing application built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, powered by the HTML5 Canvas API. It allows users to upload an image and apply multiple visual effects in real time using interactive slider controls.

The editor supports a wide range of filters such as brightness, contrast, saturation, hue rotation, blur, grayscale, sepia, opacity, and invert. All filters are configurable with defined minimum and maximum ranges, and changes are applied instantly on the canvas without altering the original image file.

A key highlight of this project is the preset system, which includes ready-made styles like Vintage, Noir, Cyberpunk, Retro Pop, Soft Glow, and more. Each preset updates both the filter values and UI sliders, enabling quick and consistent styling with a single click.

The entire filter panel is generated dynamically from a configuration object, making the application scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend. Additional features include image reset functionality, safe handling to prevent filter application before image upload, and the ability to download the edited image directly from the browser.

This project demonstrates practical skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, canvas rendering, and clean JavaScript architecture, making it a solid front-end and portfolio-ready application.
